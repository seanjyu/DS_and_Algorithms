## Sorting Algorithms
For all sorting algorithms the following tests were used
### Test 1
Sort an array in reverse order i.e. input = {10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0}, expected output = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}.
### Test 2
Test for duplicate values. i.e. input = {2, 1, 1}, expected output = {1, 1, 2}
### Test 3
General test including larger numbers and negative number, i.e. input = {100, 201, 52, 3223, 24, 55, 623, 75, 8523, -9, 150}, expected output = {-9, 24, 52, 55, 75, 100, 150, 201, 623, 3223, 8523}
